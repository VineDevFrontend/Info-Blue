                <p>I'll endure the exile I'll endure the exile The darkness of night falls around my soul And the hunter within loses control Gotta let it out, gotta let it out Gotta let it out, gotta let it out This demon inside has ahold of me Clenching its power, trying to break free Gotta let it out, gotta let it out Gotta let it out, gotta let it out Move fast, baby, don't be slow Step aside, reload, time to go I can't seem to control All this rage that's inside me Pullin' shots, aimin' dots, yeah, I don't miss Branded by fire, born in the abyss Red hot temper, I just can't resist All this vengeance inside me All of these thoughts runnin' through my head Arm on fire, veins burnin' red Frustration is gettin' bigger Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger Embrace the darkness that's within me No hiding in the shadows anymore When this wickedness consumes me Nothing can save you and there's no way out I'm a wildfire you won't tameIgniting my temper, can't put out my flame There's no way to containThis storm swelling inside me I'm a bomb you can't defuse Might just accept you're gonna lose Can't turn down, I refuse To hold back anymore All of these voices inside of my head Blinding my sight in a curtain of red Frustration is getting bigger Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger When the night ends, it's not over We fight through to get closer Like a silver bullet piercing through I throw myself into you All of these voices inside of my head Blinding my sight in a curtain of red Frustration is getting bigger Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger</p>
